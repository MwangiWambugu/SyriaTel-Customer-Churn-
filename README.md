# Analysis of SyriaTel-Customer-Churn

This repository contains the code and resources used to build a classification model for SyriaTel. The model predicts whether a customer will ("soon") stop doing business with SyriaTel based on features such as state,account length,area code,phone number,international plan,voice mail plan,number vmail messages,total day minutes,total day calls,total day charge,total eve minutes,total eve calls,total eve charge,total night minutes,total night calls,total night charge,total intl minutes,total intl calls,total intl charge,customer service calls,churn.

## Problem Statement<b>

The nature of this problem is framed by the fact that losing current customers could mean an oversight on their servie delivery. Therefore, it is much better to retain the customers that you currently have rather than to acquire new customers. Since solving this problem meant that SyriaTel could save money.<b>

## Overview

The project focuses on the creation of a machine-learning project for predicting how likely it is for Syriatel to lose a customer

## Business Understanding.<b>

Despite its past success, SyriaTel has observed concerning trends in recent years. In response, the company has initiated a comprehensive data analysis and model-building project. The objective is to identify patterns that could offer insights into customer churnâ€”determining whether a customer is likely to discontinue their services and, if possible, predicting when this might occur.<b>

## Components

* **Jupyter Notebook**
The [Jupyter Notebook]https://github.com/MwangiWambugu/SyriaTel-Customer-Churn- is our key deliverable and contains details of our approach and methodology, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and model building and validation.

* **Presentation**
The [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iONQ3BdSlUESqPkVm_ioeKWwdQ4IbuE4zmn9ZE2EOxc/edit#slide=id.p) gives a high-level overview of our approach, findings and recommendations for non-technical stakeholders. It is aimed to be between 5 and 10 minutes long.

* **Data**

The dataset can be found in the file *'./bigml_59c28831336c6604c800002a.csv'* in the Data folder, in this repository

## To get started

1. Download data from kaggle
2. Dataset can be found in the https://www.kaggle.com/code/danylozhykul/eda-telecom-churn-prediction.
3. Check requirements in Technologies section above and download libraries if necessary.

## Data Sourcing
Here we will work on retreiing the data.

## Data PreProcessing
Here we will work on data cleaning, handling missing values, data transformation, handling duplicates, data reshaping and other processes to ensure that we have a clean, structured, and suitable format for analysis and modeling.

## Data Analysis
Here we will explore the different features of the dataset to gain a better understanding of the data. We will use data vizualization to uncover trends and patterns. We will use Feature Engineering to create new features from existing ones and perform One-Hot Encoding on categorical variables that we will require for analysis.

## Model Deployment.
Here we will make sure our model can predict.
